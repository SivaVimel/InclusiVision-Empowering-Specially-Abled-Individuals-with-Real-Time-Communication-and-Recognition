# **"InclusiVision: Empowering Specially-Abled Individuals with Real-Time Communication and Recognition"**

---

**Overview:**
InclusiVision is a groundbreaking real-time communication system designed to empower specially-abled individuals through innovative technologies. This open-source project leverages Python, TensorFlow, Haar Cascade Classifier, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and state-of-the-art recognition models to enhance the daily lives of partially blind, deaf, and mute users.

**Key Features:**

- **Object Detection:** InclusiVision employs Haar Cascade Classifier to detect objects, including animals, brands, cars, faces, flowers, gods, guns, vehicle number plates, switches, restroom signs, traffic signs, and pedestrian crossings.

- **American Sign Language Recognition:** A vital tool for the deaf community, InclusiVision accurately recognizes American Sign Language gestures, enabling seamless communication.

- **Speech Recognition:** Integration with IBM Watson offers speech recognition capabilities, transforming spoken words into actionable commands.

- **Text to Speech Conversion:** Users can convert written text into natural-sounding speech, facilitating communication and information access.

- **Text Recognition:** Utilizing pytesseract, InclusiVision extracts text from images, making printed information accessible.
